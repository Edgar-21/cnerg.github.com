Automating Updates the Publication List
========================================

This script is provided to support testing of the Zotero API.  The live website
is built using Github actions that invoke similar commands without using this
script.  If you are debugging the way that the live pages use Zotero, you may
want to look into the Github workflows.

The script `update_json_w_bibtex.sh` will perform queries of the following CNERG
Publication sub-collections, getting the most recent 100 items in each and
storing them in different files.

* Refereed Publications -> pub.json
* Thesis Archive -> theses.json

In order to complete this task, the user must have [generated a Oauth
key](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys/new) with their own Zotero account.
That key should exist in a the file `zotero/zotero.key.header`.  This file
should only contain the following:

```
Zotero-API-Key: <key-goes-here>
```

where `<key-goes-here>` should be replaced with your own custom key which will
be a 24 character string composed of upper- and lower-case letters and numbers.

When generating the key, it is (probably) necessary to select "Allow library
access" and "Read Only" for the Default Group Permissions.
