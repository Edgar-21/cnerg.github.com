## Research Interests

 * Monte Carlo Methods
    * Nonorthogonal functional expansion tallies (FET)
    * Computer Aided Design (CAD) based transport
    * Ray tracing
 * Neutronics Methods
 * Neutronics as a tool
    * Computer Integrated Engineering workflows
    * Software Defined Modeling
    * Radiation Damage Modeling
    * Software Quality Assurance

## Academic Research

Micah is currently researching the feasibility of using [Non-uniform rational B-spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline) (NURBS) 
as a possible basis for functional expansion tallies (FET) in Monte Carlo radiation transport.
NURBS are primarily used in CAD as the mathematical way to represent the complicated surfaces that can be present in CAD,
and they have shown to be very useful in this role.
NURBS as a class of FET bases show great potential for being generalized FET bases.

### Publications

 * Micah D. Gale, Patrick C. Shriwise, and Paul P. H. Wilson, "Working with Bézier Curves as Nonorthogonal Bases for Functional Expansion Tallies", 
*International Conference on Mathematics and Computational Methods Applied to Nuclear Science and Engineering (M&C 2025)*, Accepted.

## National Laboratory Projects

* Micah is the lead developer of the Open-Source Python library: [MontePy](https://github.com/idaholab/montepy). [MontePy](https://www.montepy.org/en/stable/) is the most user-friendly Python library for reading, editing, and writing [MCNP](https://mcnp.lanl.gov/) input files in an object-oriented way.

* Micah previously worked in the Irradiation Experiments Neutronics Analysis department. 
In that work he conducted neutronics analyses to support irradiation of fuels and materials experiments using MCNP and SCALE.
