## Research Interests
* Multiphysics modeling and simulation
* Neutronics for reactor design
* Monte Carlo methods for radiation transport
* Generation IV reactors
* High Performance Computing
* Open-Source Software

## Current Projects
* [Cardinal](https://github.com/neams-th-coe/cardinal) is an Open-Source [MOOSE](https://github.com/idaholab/moose) (Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment) Application developed at Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign. I am using it to model the [Virtual Test Bed's Gas Cooled Microreactor](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/virtual_test_bed/microreactors/gcmr/)
* [OpenMC](https://github.com/openmc-dev/openmc) is an Open-Source Monte Carlo code developed at Argonne National Laboratory. It is one of the tools that interfaces with Cardinal

## Education
* University of Wisconsin - Madison, PhD Nuclear Engineering, Current Student
* University of Wisconsin - Madison, MS Nuclear Engineering, Fall 2020
* University of Wisconsin - Madison, BS Nuclear Engineering, Certificates in Mathematics and Physics Summer 2018

## Publications
* [Verification of the Cardinal Multiphysics Solver for 1-D Coupled Heat Transfer and Neutron Transport](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373173646_Verification_of_the_Cardinal_Multiphysics_Solver_for_1-D_Coupled_Heat_Transfer_and_Neutron_Transport).
