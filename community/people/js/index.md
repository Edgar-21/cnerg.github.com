## Biography

Jordanâ€™s research focuses on machine learning applications to nuclear
nonproliferation. In particular, he is using gamma radiation measurements
collected for the NNSA NA-22 Multi-Informatics for Nuclear Operations
Scenarios testbed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to train models
capable of detecting shielded radiological material transfers.
State-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques require large volumes
of labeled data to train a successful model. Characterizing radiation
data often involves manual analysis by subject-matter experts which is
time consuming, resource intensive, and unfeasible for leveraging machine
learning. Jordan is addressing this by using semi-supervised machine
learning to utilize labeled and unlabeled radiation measurements to design
models that can be used for more informed decisions and resource
efficiency in nuclear security. His research is supported by the NNSA
Consortium for Enabling Technology and Innovation (ETI) under the
computer and engineering sciences for nonproliferation thrust. Originally
from Detroit, Jordan spends his free time gardening and cooking with his
wife, daughter, and dog.
