## Current and Recent Projects

*  I'm using and developing new features for the Argonne Low-Carbon Energy
   Framework (A-LEAF) software tool. A-LEAF is an optimization-based tool which
   finds global least-cost solutions to unit commitment, economic dispatch, and
   capacity expansion.
*  Developing agent-based modeling capabilities for A-LEAF, in order to
   realistically simulate the capital investment choices of agents operating
   with limited local information and acting to maximize local benefits, using
   real-options valuation and portfolio optimization. Capabilities will help to
   characterize the economic and technical performance parameters required for
   advanced reactors to be viable commercial products.
*  Assessing economic impact of increased electric vehicle deployments and
   varied charging patterns on the economic viability of nuclear power
*  Modeling economic impact of minute- and hour-scale load-following
   capabilities for nuclear reactors in an ERCOT-like electricity market system
