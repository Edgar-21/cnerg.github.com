department chair of the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu)‘s
[Department of Engineering Physics](http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ep). His research
uses computer models to improve the designs of complex nuclear energy systems
and to shed light on important policy apsects of the nuclear fuel cycle,
including nuclear waste management and non-proliferation. Paul joined the
University of Wisconsin-Madison as an assistant professor in August 2001 as part
of the [Energy Systems and Policy Hiring

Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and raised in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada,
Paul has a Bachelor of Applied Science from the [University of
Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca) (1992), a doctoral degree in mechanical
engineering from the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu)
(1998), and a PhD. in Nuclear Engineering and Engineering Physics from [U.
Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu) (1999).

Paul has been active in the [American Nuclear Society](https://www.ans.org) for
over 30 years and was the founding president of the [North American Young
Generation in Nuclear [NA-YGN]](https://www.naygn.org). He represented the ANS
and NA-YGN at the [international climate change negotiations](http://unfccc.int)
in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1998), and Bonn, Germany (1999). He is also a member
